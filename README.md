3. URL for the chat ID: https://api.telegram.org/botPLACE_HERE_THE_TOKEN/getUpdates --> now open this in a browser and copy the "Chat ID" (e.g. "-584738495") 


If you now open this URL (place there your token) in a browser a message to the Telegram Group will be send automatically

# https://api.telegram.org/botPLACE_HERE_THE_TOKEN/sendMessage?chat_id=-530836315&text="This_is_a_test!"

            "Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
            "I hate Russian dolls… they're so full of themselves!",
